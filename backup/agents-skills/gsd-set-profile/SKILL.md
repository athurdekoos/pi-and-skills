<pi_skill_adapter>
Pi coding agent mode:
- This skill is invoked via /skill:SKILL_NAME or when the task matches the description.
- Use the read tool to load referenced files (paths starting with @).
- Treat @ path references as files to read with the read tool.
- For subagent patterns, work inline in the current session.
</pi_skill_adapter>

<objective>
Switch the model profile used by GSD agents. Controls which Claude model each agent uses, balancing quality vs token spend.

Routes to the set-profile workflow which handles:
- Argument validation (quality/balanced/budget)
- Config file creation if missing
- Profile update in config.json
- Confirmation with model table display
</objective>

<execution_context>

</execution_context>

<process>
**Follow the set-profile workflow** from `@/home/mia/.agents/get-shit-done/workflows/set-profile.md`.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Profile argument validation
2. Config file ensuring
3. Config reading and updating
4. Model table generation from MODEL_PROFILES
5. Confirmation display
</process>
