<pi_skill_adapter>
Pi coding agent mode:
- This skill is invoked via /skill:SKILL_NAME or when the task matches the description.
- Use the read tool to load referenced files (paths starting with @).
- Treat @ path references as files to read with the read tool.
- For subagent patterns, work inline in the current session.
</pi_skill_adapter>

<objective>
Restore complete project context and resume work seamlessly from previous session.

Routes to the resume-project workflow which handles:

- STATE.md loading (or reconstruction if missing)
- Checkpoint detection (.continue-here files)
- Incomplete work detection (PLAN without SUMMARY)
- Status presentation
- Context-aware next action routing
  </objective>

<execution_context>
@/home/mia/.agents/get-shit-done/workflows/resume-project.md
</execution_context>

<process>
**Follow the resume-project workflow** from `@/home/mia/.agents/get-shit-done/workflows/resume-project.md`.

The workflow handles all resumption logic including:

1. Project existence verification
2. STATE.md loading or reconstruction
3. Checkpoint and incomplete work detection
4. Visual status presentation
5. Context-aware option offering (checks CONTEXT.md before suggesting plan vs discuss)
6. Routing to appropriate next command
7. Session continuity updates
   </process>
