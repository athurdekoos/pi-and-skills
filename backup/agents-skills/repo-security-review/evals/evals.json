      "expected_output": "A structured report covering all 8 domains with severity-rated findings, starting with recon to identify the stack and then running through secrets, dependencies, SAST, IaC, CI/CD, auth, API security, and data protection checks.",

      "expected_output": "A targeted IaC security review focusing on Terraform files, checking for overpermissioned IAM, public S3 buckets, unencrypted storage, open security groups, and exposed state files. Should also do a quick secrets scan on tfvars files.",
